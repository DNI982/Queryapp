/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for data sources, where users can only manage their own connections.
 * Super-admins have full access to all data, including user profiles and pending user requests.
 * The ruleset also implements role-based access control for managing permissions, with super-admins having the ability to define fine-grained access to different modules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including their role.
 * - /pendingUsers/{userId}: Stores user registration requests pending approval.
 * - /dataSources/{dataSourceId}: Stores data source connections, with an `ownerId` field indicating the owner.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores role-based permissions for different modules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list their own data sources.
 * - Only super-admins can manage user profiles and pending user requests.
 * - Role-based access control is enforced for managing permissions, with super-admins having full control.
 * - Data shapes are NOT fully enforced in this prototyping phase, but authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `dataSource` documents contain an `ownerId` field to simplify ownership checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Pending user requests are stored in a separate collection (/pendingUsers) to isolate them from approved user profiles.
