/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-level ownership for data sources.
 * User profiles are public, but only super-admins can manage pending user approvals and permissions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profiles.  The document ID is equal to the user's UID.
 * - /pendingUsers/{userId}: Stores user registration requests.  Managed only by super-admins. The document ID is equal to the user's UID.
 * - /dataSources/{dataSourceId}: Stores connection details for data sources, owned by individual users.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores role-based permissions. Only managed by super-admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are publicly readable but only writable by the user themselves (for profile updates) or a super-admin.
 * - Listing of users and pendingUsers is denied to prevent information disclosure.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Data sources store the ownerId directly in the document to simplify ownership checks.
