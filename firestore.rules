/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with strict ownership constraints where appropriate.
 * Super-admins have full access. Other roles have limited access based on pre-defined permissions.
 * User data is generally private, with some exceptions for public read access where explicitly specified.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, including roles.
 * - /pendingUsers/{userId}: Stores registration requests pending approval.
 * - /dataSources/{dataSourceId}: Stores database connection information.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores module-specific role permissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is only allowed for super-admins.
 * - Data validation is minimized to facilitate rapid prototyping and schema evolution.
 * - Read access is generally open, but write access is strictly controlled based on role and ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User roles are stored directly within the `/users/{userId}` document to avoid needing a separate lookup.
