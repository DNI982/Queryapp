/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-level ownership for data sources.
 * Super-admins can manage user roles and permissions. Data validation is relaxed to prioritize rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, including their role.
 * - /pendingUsers/{userId}: Stores pending user registration requests.
 * - /dataSources/{dataSourceId}: Stores data source connection details, with ownerId indicating the creator.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores role-based permissions for different modules, managed by super-admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are readable by anyone, but only the owner or a super-admin can modify them.
 * - Listing of users is denied.
 * - Data sources are owned by the user who created them and can only be modified or deleted by the owner.
 * - Permissions are managed by super-admins.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `ownerId` field is included in the `dataSources` documents to allow for simple ownership checks.
