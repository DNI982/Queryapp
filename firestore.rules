/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-ownership for data sources.
 * The rules are designed to be highly secure, restricting data access based on user roles and ownership,
 * while providing a flexible data structure that can evolve rapidly.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with roles determining access privileges.
 * - /pendingUsers/{pendingUserId}: Stores pending user registration requests.
 * - /dataSources/{dataSourceId}: Stores data source connections, with access controlled by ownership.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores role-based permissions for different modules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all user profiles; only super-admins can.
 * - Data sources are owned by individual users, who have full control over them.
 * - Pending user requests can only be created by the user themselves and managed by super-admins.
 * - The rules do NOT validate the entire object shape, but focus on authorization and relational integrity.
